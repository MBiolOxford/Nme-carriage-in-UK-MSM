# Nme-carriage-in-UK-MSM
The '_Nme_ carriage in UK MSM' repository contains the code used during my Master's (MBiol) project titled '_Neisseria meningitidis_ oropharyngeal carriage, antimicrobial resistance, and associated risk factors in men who have sex with men in the UK'.
The repository consists of R scripts performing statistical analyses.
